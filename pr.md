The page is nice to look at and easy to read. It also works great in mobile view. Honestly, this site is probably better than mine. In retrospect there are a lot of things I would change about my site, mostly about the size of text and and stuff.The codebase here is also a lot better, with multiple CSS files instead of one. I probably could have used a different CSS file for my joke page. The only real issue I have is that the text in the aboute me section is too small, and that the image on the home page is scaled weirdly. I would try to make the image on the home page look less squished, and increase the size of the text on mobile.
